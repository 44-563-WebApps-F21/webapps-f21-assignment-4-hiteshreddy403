    <h3> ACT IV. _Same as Act II_. </h3>
    <pre>
<p>Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house</p>
<p><h6>JAMES</h6></p>.<p>Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord</p>
<p><h6>LORD GORING</h6></p><p>Lady Chiltern not down yet?</p>
<p><h6>JAMES</h6></p><p>Her ladyship has not yet left her room. Miss Chiltern has just
come in from riding.</p>
<p><h6>LORD GORING</h6><p>[_To himself_.]</p><p>Ah! that is something.</p>
<p><h6>JAMES</h6></p><p>Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
Robert. I told him your lordship was here.</p>
<p><h6>LORD GORING.</h6></p><p>Thank you! Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?</p>
<p><h6>JAMES</h6></p><p>[_Bowing_.]</p><p>I shall do so, my lord.</p>
<p>[_Exit servant_.]</p>
<p><h6>LORD GORING.</h6></p><p>Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
It is a great deal too much excitement for any son. I hope to goodness
he won’t come up. Fathers should be neither seen nor heard. . Mothers are different. Mothers are
darlings.</p><p>[_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and
begins to read it_.]</p>
<p>[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]</p>
<p><h6>LORD CAVERSHAM</h6></p><p>Well, sir, what are you doing here? Wasting your time
as usual, I suppose?</p>
<p><h6>LORD GORING</h6></p><p>[_Throws down paper and rises_.]</p><p>My dear father, when one
pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
one’s own.</p>
<p><h6>LORD CAVERSHAM</h6></p><p>Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
last night?</p>
