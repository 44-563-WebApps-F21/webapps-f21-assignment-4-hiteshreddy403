            <br> _Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_.
            <br>

            JAMES.  Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.
            <br>

LORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern not down yet?
<br>

JAMES.  Her ladyship has not yet left her room.  Miss Chiltern has just
come in from riding. 
<br>

LORD GORING.  [_To himself_.]  Ah! that is something.
<br>

JAMES.  Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
Robert.  I told him your lordship was here.
<br>

LORD GORING.  Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?
<br>

JAMES.  [_Bowing_.]  I shall do so, my lord.
<br>

[_Exit servant_.]
<br>

LORD GORING.  Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.  I hope to goodness
he won’t come up.  Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the
only proper basis for family life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are
darlings.  [_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and
begins to read it_.]
<br>

[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]
<br>

LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
as usual, I suppose?
<br>

LORD GORING.  [_Throws down paper and rises_.]  My dear father, when one
pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
one’s own.
<br>

LORD CAVERSHAM.  Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
last night?
